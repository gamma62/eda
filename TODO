BUGS:
- session leader must be set in all cases, not only in ish buffer: 
  in sh buffer does not work 'man --ascii -P cat eda'
fixed

- simple_parser() was limited to input lines with max.256 bytes; find results were not parsed;
fixed

- /usr/local/share found in edamacro in the release package, should be /usr/share
fixed

- with files having cr/lf lines there is a design level bug:
  insert actions after file end will add characters before lf,
  that means: between cr and lf; thats bad
  deleol, join_line, and maybe the block level join tool also
wip

FEATURE: python error parser
  - ongoing: python -m py_compile script ; pyflakes script ; pylint -E script
done

FEATURE: m1 command as 'more 1'
  - expanding filter blocks up and down  

operation restricted to current selection block
  - like indent/unindent but only surrounding selection
  - replace, comment, uncomment, ...

FEATURE: xml/html tag support
  - tomatch for tag tokens, block folding, etc

FEATURE: hashtab for the commands and keyboard inputs
  - first part ready: perfect hash (all keys found slot in first round)
  - second step: generate this during the build
  --- much better: hashtab for key codes (fixed size table), balanced tree for commands and macros (frequent changes)
push by side, hashtab branch

FEATURE: more suupport for indentation based structures ?
  - like python
  - in general: folding, function name, ...
