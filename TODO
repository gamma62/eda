BUGS:
- session leader must be set in all cases, not only in ish buffer: 
  in sh buffer does not work 'man --ascii -P cat eda'
fixed

- simple_parser() was limited to input lines with max.256 bytes; find results were not parsed;
fixed

- /usr/local/share found in edamacro in the release package, should be /usr/share
fixed

- with files having cr/lf lines there is a design level bug:
  insert actions after file end will add characters before lf,
  that means: between cr and lf; thats bad
  deleol, join_line, and maybe the block level join tool also
??
