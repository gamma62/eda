FEATURE: hashtab for the commands and keyboard inputs
  - first part ready: perfect hash (all keys found slot in first round)
  - second step: generate this during the build
  - or runtime with key-tester and set parameters in config
postponed, hashtab branch

FEATURE: secret store, eda extension: my secrets with gcrypt
  - cnf.phrase[]=mysecret -- default:empty
  - cnf.sfile[]=secret.gpg -- default:empty
  - ##design/implementation missing
  - read_phrase(buffer, secret=False)
  - ##reading into special-buffer *secret*, remember filename, ask for passphrase if empty
  - gpg -d --yes --batch --passphrase=<phrase> <gpgfile> 2>/dev/null
  - command: gde.crypt [alt.filename]
  - ##write back / overwrite
  - lines of *gpg* | gpg --yes --batch --passphrase=<phrase> -o <gpgfile> -c -
