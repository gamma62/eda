README for Eda

eda - text editor and source code analyzer


INSTALL
-----------------
  tar xzf eda-0.9.37.tar.gz
  make
  sudo make install
  make clean

FILES
-----------------
configuration: /etc/eda/
datadir: /usr/share/eda
datadir: /usr/local/share
manuals: /usr/local/man
docs: /usr/local/share/doc
user configuration, macros, everything: ~/.eda/

post install
---------------------
copy edarc from /etc/eda to ~/.eda/ and update the following fields
  find_path make_path sh_path diff_path
  vcstool ...
do not use sh, use bash instead

copy edamacro from /usr/local/share/eda/ to ~/.eda/
add your custom macros based on samples, see eda(1) and edamacro(5)

optionally, copy edaseq and edakeys from /usr/local/share/eda/ to ~/.eda/
edaseq contains the escape sequencies for function and control keys
edakeys contains the key -> function binding (default values)
update key bindings and check it with 'eda -k'

eda works well with xterm but needs meta keys must send escape
sample .Xdefaults for configuration
!!!
XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
! font and sizes (example)
XTerm*faceName: Liberation Mono
XTerm*faceSize: 14
XTerm*faceSize1: 10
XTerm*faceSize2: 12
XTerm*faceSize3: 16
XTerm*faceSize4: 18
XTerm*faceSize5: 20
XTerm*faceSize6: 22
! not important for eda, just an example
XTerm*foreground: DarkGrey
XTerm*background: black
!!!

for other terminal emulators, create compatible settings
set similar colors like in xterm
  or run 'eda -c' and create custom color palette, add to edarc
disable conflicting Function and Alt- key bindings (this is important)
  run 'eda -k' and test Func, Shift-Func, Del, BackSpace, cursor keys with Ctrl- and Alt-
select-word-characters: -A-Za-z0-9._+ (this is optional)

external tools
---------------------
the tools with _path in edarc are mandatory, like diff, bash

VCS (Version Control System) like hg, git, svn/svnlite, etc for development
  upto 10 VCS tools, see edarc and edamacro, the diff must be a unified diff

sed, awk, make and compile tools, checkers, formatters -- see edamacro

something for clipboard i/o (for example xsel) -- see edamacro

ctags is supported for development
