post install config:
---------------------
eda works well with xterm, xfce4-terminal, gnome-terminal, etc
the eda wrapper script, xeda, uses "x-terminal-emulator -e eda ..." call,
whatever alternative you choose, some config is necessary
 * to have all key bindings available in eda (this is important)
 * to select the right terminal colors (nice to have)
tested on ubuntu 9.04 and debian 6.0.1 and later versions

what the terminal emulator should do (or donot do)
1. send esc sequence on Meta-XXX keys
2. do not catch simple Ctrl-key and Meta-key combinations,
and function keys, base and with Ctrl modifier
see output of "cmds" in eda, what key we wish to use
3. key bindings can be redefined, see /etc/eda/edakeys

  === gnome-terminal
  = gnome-terminal sends esc sequence on Meta-XXX keys by default
  Compatibility: keep defaults
    Backspace key generates: ASCII DEL
    Delete key generates: Escape sequence
  Select-by-word-characters: optional change, for convenience
    from -A-Za-z0-9,./?%&#:_=+@~
    to   -A-Za-z0-9._+
  Keyboard Shortcuts: suggested changes, gnome-terminal should not catch keys
    disable menu access, menu shortcut keys, Alt+<number> keys (important)
    use Alt+Left, Alt+Right for Prev/Next tab switch
    keep Shift+Control+[A-Z] keys and Control+[0+-] keys for zoom

  === xterm
  = xterm sends high bit if Meta-  modifier is down, in this case add the following define to your config.h
  #define META_SETS_HIGHBIT
  = otherwise, to receive escape sequencies, add this line to /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm
  *metaSendsEscape: true

  === switch BackSpace and Ctrl-H
  = if you have no other choice, BackSpace and Ctrl-H can be switched in eda, if you add this line to your config.h
  #define THE_BACKSPACE_C_H_CHEAT

  === project files
  the project can contain the project file itself, but
  project files are strict on line numbers, if the line number is invalid the project open fails


extensions:
------------
the macro API is ready, edamacro contains some examples also
see the detailed function API in edamacro(5)


benefits:
----------
+ eda is actually an editor and a regexp based filter engine in one,
  filters provide layers of visible lines to edit the file transparently,
  filter masks can be switched and copied up and down easily
+ line based selection handling for cp/mv/rm and (un)indent/(un)shift,
+ operations on block of lines like for single lines, pad, cut/lcut, join
+ folding whole functions or blocks, jump to matching brace, etc
+ regex based search, highlight (patterns or lines), replace
+ multifile search, external and internal
+ external tools (make, find/egrep, version control) binding
+ parsers for external and internal tools (make, lsdir, etc)
+ output filter APIs for printing (a2ps) or others (indent, macros, etc)
+ bookmarks, motion history, projects
+ version control tools supported: cvs, subversion, mercurial
+ macro interface (with record facility)
+ ctags support, show value, jump to definition
there are lot of invisible features, the useful ones were kept and improved,
the useless or experimental ones were pushed to the archive

Eda is engine oriented, the GUI is replaceble and less important.
The main target in the development was to have a flexible design, open for
changes in the engine, without restrictions from GUI.

The 0.9.53 version is a public birthday.
